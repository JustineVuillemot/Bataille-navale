# Bataille-navale

## What is it ?

This project is a C version of the Battleships game using a graphic library named MLV (after the university where it was developed).

## Why do this project ?

It was a project realised during a C course at IMAC engineering school in Paris.

## How to test it ?

### With a Linux environment

The project was coded on a Debian environment so you can easily launch it just after download by executing the `Makefile` and then executing the file `executable`.

### With a windows environment

I haven't personnaly tested it but I think it could be launched with a compiler like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks or Clion.

## Credits

The project was coded with Pauline Legros who can not appear on this repo because the project was added after being finished. We both worked equally together to create it.
